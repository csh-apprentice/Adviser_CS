This directory contains the velocity time series data plotted in both papers.
The region covers the main trunk of PIG.

The earlier data (VelPIG.TSX.20YY-MM-DD.v?.tif) are derived from TerraSAR-X data.
The date in the file name gives the central date for the estimate, which was derived
from data that span a range of several months about this date. Because of the limited
extent of TSX images, maps are not full coverage.

The later data (VelPIG.S1Quarterly.20YY-MM-DD.v?.tif) are derived from Copernicus
Sentinel 1A/B data, which are derived from images processed by ESA and
distributed by ASF). The estimates are computed quarterly so the data used to
produce them span the 3-month period centered on the date in the file name.
The coverage is more complete, although gaps remain where good speckle
tracking matches were not possible (the Amundsen Sea Embayment is one
of the more challenging areas for speckle tracking due to the high accumulation rates). 

Each product consists of 2 geotifs with epsg 3031 (NSIDC Polar Stereographic for Antarctica),
containing the vx and vy velocity components.

The paper: Ice-Shelf Retreat Drives Recent Pine Island Glacier Speedup
(in revision at Science Advances), when it is published should serve as the reference for these data.
