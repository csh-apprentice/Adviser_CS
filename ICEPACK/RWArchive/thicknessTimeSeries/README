These are the ice thickness and and shelf masks used to estimate thinning
rates used in the melt calculation described in the Supplement to
"Ocean-Induced Melt Volume Directly Paces Ice Loss from Pine Island Glacier"

The thickness (thickness.20??.tif)  is derived from hydrostatic equilibrium
applied to a series of elevation maps referenced to the EGM2008 ellipsoid
(zsurf.20??.egm2008.tif).

The shelf mask (shelf.20??.tif)  is determined from regions where the surface
elevation exceeds the height above flotation based on pigmcbed.adjusted.2017.tif.

The elevations are an updated version of the data described in Regularized
