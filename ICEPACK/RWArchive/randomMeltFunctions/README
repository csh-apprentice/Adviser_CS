This directory contains randomly generated melt parameters.

Whether held constant in time or varying about a constant mean, the same set of
realizations was used for each melt value (e.g., 100GT), which are indicated by
the file names:

randomMelt.100GT.yaml
randomMelt.125GT.yaml
randomMelt.57GT.yaml
randomMelt.75GT.yaml

The script readMelt.py illustrates how the files can be read and the melt computed.
Note the results will be in a icepack/firedrake variable format.  

For all of the simulations described in each paper, only the first 30 realizations were used.

New realizations can be generated with the script in this directory computeMeltParams.py.
